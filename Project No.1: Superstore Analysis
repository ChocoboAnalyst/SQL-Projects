The "so what?" and interesting findings:

	1)	The Premium Coffee Maker (4.9 stars) and Memory Foam Mattress (4.8 stars) have the highest ratings, indicating strong customer satisfaction.
	2)	The Smart Home Security Camera (4.1 stars) and Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (4.2 stars) have the lowest ratings among electronics, which might indicate quality or performance concerns.
	3)	The business could focus marketing on high-rated products (Coffee Maker, Mattress) while improving lower-rated ones to maintain customer trust.
	4)	Consider reducing stock levels of slow-moving items if they are not selling fast. I would like to know data for monthly product turnover and see if further tuning can be done here. 
	5)	Boost advertising for top-rated items to leverage customer satisfaction for increased sales. 
	6)	Piggybacking on the second point, reevaluating lower-rated products to see if quality improvements or better pricing can improve sales may be a point of focus. 4.1 stars may not be a bad performance indicator on the surface, but based on weighted averages, 
                there is a clear significant difference between 4.1 and say, 4.8. A 4.1 rating may suggest considerable flaws in the product. An analysis of customer comments or reasons for return may reveal interesting findings.
